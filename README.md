# Python-reusables

This is meant to hold a set of minimal classes/modules that work on both Python 2 and 3. I created
this since most of the times I don't want to use bloated external libraries. I usually end up doing my own modules and since I don't want to reinvent the wheel more than once, I will store everything here so I can reuse the stuff in the future.

Modules here are meant to:
 * Have a minimal API
 * Support Python2 and Python3
 * Be generic
